        What happens if you start with a value and keep multiplying it by itself many times?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Let’s take 2 and see the sequence.
        2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>5</sup> … and so on.
        <span>It quickly gets larger and larger, approaching infinity.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span>Let’s start with 0.5:</span>
      <span>
      0.5, 0.25, 0.0625, 0.00390625… It is quickly approaching zero.

      How about 1?

      1, 1, 1, 1… Boring.
    <span>
    And negative numbers immediately turn positive and follow the same sequences.
    </span> </p></p><span>
    So, we can see that any number between -1 and 1 (inclusive) will not go to infinity, and any number greater than 1 or smaller than -1 will. The closer it is to 1 when it starts, the slower it will move away from 1.
    </span> </p></p><span>
    Now, imagine we are talking about 2D numbers. Technically we are not talking about vectors, 
    but for now don’t worry about how they work, just see them as x and y pairs.
    </span> </p></p><span>
    A 2D version of the above gives us a circle with radius 1, within which the 2D numbers decay to zero, and outside numbers shoot off to the infinite borders.
    </span> </p></p><span>
    If we colour all numbers that collapse to zero black, and all numbers that grow larger according to how fast they shoot off to infinity, we get a black circle surrounded by a nice gradient of colours (colours are an artistic choice).
